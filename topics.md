Phase 1: Fundamentals and Setup
Objective: Understand the basic concepts, terminology, and installation procedures.

1. Introduction to Observability
Concepts: Metrics, Logs, Traces

Metrics types: Counter, Gauge, Histogram, Summary

Difference between monitoring and observability

Concepts: RED (Rate, Errors, Duration) vs USE (Utilization, Saturation, Errors)

2. Prometheus Overview
What is Prometheus?

Key Components: Prometheus Server, Exporters, Pushgateway, Service Discovery, Alertmanager

Data Model and Metric Types

3. Grafana Overview
Grafanaâ€™s role in observability

Dashboards, Panels, and Visualizations

Connecting Grafana with Prometheus

4. Setup and Installation
Install Prometheus locally and on a Kubernetes cluster

Install Grafana locally and on Kubernetes

Basic configuration for both

5. First Metrics Collection
Set up Node Exporter

Collect system metrics from servers

Visualize metrics with a basic Grafana dashboard

Phase 2: Intermediate Usage
Objective: Develop proficiency in querying, dashboards, and basic alerts.

1. PromQL (Prometheus Query Language)
Basic queries and functions

Advanced queries: aggregation, rate(), irate(), increase(), histogram quantiles

Filtering metrics and metric relabeling

2. Grafana Dashboards
Dashboard creation and customization

Panel types: Graph, Stat, Gauge, Bar Chart, Table

Variables, Templating, and Annotations

Importing and exporting dashboards (Grafana Labs)

3. Alerting Basics with Alertmanager
Alerting rules syntax and configuration

Introduction to Alertmanager configuration and routing

Sending alerts to email, Slack, PagerDuty, Webhooks

4. Application Instrumentation
Instrument applications using Prometheus client libraries (Go, Python, Java, Node.js)

Best practices for defining application metrics

Custom metrics exposure through HTTP endpoints

Phase 3: Advanced Observability
Objective: Master complex use-cases, best practices, advanced queries, alerting, and observability at scale.

1. Advanced PromQL and Metrics
Deep dive into advanced PromQL queries and patterns

Histograms, quantile calculations, latency analysis

Recording rules for precomputed metrics and performance optimization

2. Advanced Grafana Usage
Advanced dashboard optimization and automation

Integration with logs (Loki) and tracing systems (Tempo, Jaeger)

Using Grafana alerts (Grafana Unified Alerting)

3. Advanced Alerting with Alertmanager
Complex Alertmanager configurations (high availability, clustering)

Advanced routing, silencing, inhibitions

Customizing notification templates and webhooks

Managing alert fatigue and fine-tuning alert severity

4. Scaling and High Availability
Prometheus federation

Prometheus high availability setups (Thanos, Cortex, VictoriaMetrics)

Long-term storage and high-performance querying

5. Security and Best Practices
Securing Prometheus and Grafana (authentication, TLS, OAuth)

Metric cardinality management and resource usage optimization

Backup, restore, and disaster recovery strategies

Phase 4: Production-grade Observability
Objective: Handle observability in a large-scale production environment, focusing on robustness, integration, and operational excellence.

1. Observability at Scale
Large-scale Prometheus setups: Thanos/Cortex/VictoriaMetrics

Operational insights: Resource monitoring, bottlenecks, query optimization

2. Observability-Driven Development
Leveraging observability to influence application architecture

Continuous observability integration in CI/CD pipelines

Automatic instrumentation and observability-as-code

3. Advanced Integration and Ecosystem
Integrating with tracing and logging (Jaeger, Tempo, Loki)

Unified observability stack (Metrics, Logs, Traces correlation)

Building advanced dashboards and observability runbooks
